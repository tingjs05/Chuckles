## Description
You, the main character, comes from a wealthy family who lives in a huge mansion. Behind this mansion, there is a forest that you and your younger brother enjoy playing in. 
<br><br>
However, on that fateful night, your brother was ambushed by some clown, and went missing. When the police came to investigate in the morning, no body was found, there was no evidence. You kept telling the adults that you saw a clown, but your parents didn't believe you, they thought you were crazy. 
<br><br>
Since there isn't any evidence suggesting that you are the culprit...
*(not done)*

## About
This is a 2.5D Top-Down Horror game made using the Unity game engine for Global Game Jam 2024 (GGJ 2024). The theme for this game jam is "Make Me Laugh". We were then given 72 hours to created a game based on this topic. 
<br><br>
Instead of going for the obviously happy theme for a game, our decided to put our own twist on the theme. We decided to incoperate the "Laughing" into the clown enemy, who would giggle and laugh as he tries to kill you. The "Make Me Laugh" aspect is also shown when the player needs to laugh into their microphone to try baiting the clown in certain directions to achieve the objective. We hope you enjoy this game!
